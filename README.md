# Problem Statement
Educational institutions often struggle to identify which student behaviors most strongly influence academic performance and which students are at risk of failure. This project analyzes student behavioral data to uncover key drivers of exam performance and identify high-risk students for early intervention.
# Business Questions
1. Does attendance affect exam scores?
2. Do study hours improve performance?
3. How does sleep quality impact results?
4. Which study method performs best?
6. Who are the high-risk students?

# Dataset Overview
The dataset includes student-level data such as:
- Exam scores
- Attendance rate
- Study hours
- Sleep hours and sleep quality
- Study methods
- Internet access

# Tools Used
- Power BI (data modeling, DAX, visualization)
- Excel (initial cleaning and validation)
- DAX (measures, calculated columns, risk modeling)

# Key Insights
1. Attendance is the strongest predictor of exam performance.
2. Study hours improve performance up to a point, after which returns diminish.
3. Optimal sleep duration (7–8 hours) is linked to better academic outcomes.
4. Active study methods outperform passive learning approaches.
5. Academic risk is cumulative, driven by multiple behavioral factors.

# Recommendations
1. Implement early attendance monitoring systems.
2. Promote effective and structured study methods.
3. Educate students on healthy sleep habits.
4. Prioritize early support for students exhibiting multiple risk indicators.
